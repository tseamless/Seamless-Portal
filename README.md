# Seamless
Sugary goodness is for everybody. But certain people have to take precaution with it and deal with it more than others. Of course that is time-consuming and demanding, which is exactly why we decided to tackle diabetes at the 2016 Medrockweek. We are working on an app that helps people with diabetes seamlessly monitor and manage the disease. Our main goal is to keep everything as simple as possible in order to reduce the time spent on handling the disease.
